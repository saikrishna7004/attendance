Hey, there!

We saw lot of feedbacks over an year regarding Astra, so I just want to answer the most asked questions.

Here are few basic guidelines for using Astra, and responses to the feedbacks.

1. Enter your Roll No., i.e., JNTU Roll No. in the field provided. If it says Roll No. doesn't exist, please enter your Roll No., and Netra ID in "Add your Roll No. Here" Link provided below the Homepage.
2. The "Remember Me" button is there for those who doesn't want to enter their Roll No. everytime. Click it after you enter your Roll No., and it'll come the next time, without you manually entering again.
3. The Attendance shown is READ ONLY, we cannot edit!!
4. Detailed analysis of the Attendance data is not possible, because of the limitations of Netra and Sanjaya, as we rely on them for attendance.
4. Remember, Astra is nowhere responsible for the Attendance shown. The attendance that is present in Netra or Sanjaya is shown in Astra, not our own attendance.
5. The main motive of Astra is to see the Attendance Percentage, without logging in each time into Netra or Sanjaya, and reduce efforts.
6. Misuse of Astra is strictly not tolerated. 
7. This is not an official app by the management, so don't show this to any faculty for any concerns.
8. All the feedbacks are considered, and some good features are being added further, thanks for that.
9. Remember, this is not for selling the data or misusing, just increasing the ease of Attendance.
10. Related to the concerns regarding UI, we wantedly made the interface simple, not to over complicate things.

> *Note*: We are no where responsible for your absence, just because your attendance is shown.

> In a further release, a forum is being introduced, where you can post your issues, and they will be answered.
